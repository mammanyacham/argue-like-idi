What is this?

Argue Like Idris is a browser-based game that tests your wit and stubbornness.
You are presented with an argument and four response options, but only one is the true Idris answer — confident, unapologetic, and undeniably chaotic.

Pick wisely, or be schooled by Idris! 😏

How to Play

Open index.html in your browser.

Click Next, then Start Game.

Read the argument and select the response Idris would actually give.

Repeat and enjoy the chaos!

How It Works

Arguments and responses are stored in argument.json.

JavaScript dynamically loads and displays them.

Each option button is assigned an option from the JSON.

Idris’ correct response is pre-determined, creating the challenge.
